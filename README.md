# Getting Started with Create React App

Deployed at - [https://downtime-monitor.web.app/](https://downtime-monitor.web.app/)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Important Information

- in `utilities/axios.js`, the `baseURL` for backend API can be changed.

- The backend is deployed on Heroku which in the free tier does not work as expected with cron jobs. I request you to please run the project locally and test the cron job along with other API end-points.
